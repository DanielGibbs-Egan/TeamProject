This is the secret dialogue you can only call manually by calling get(10)
[SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the Palace of Pranks.]
SpongeBob: Well, Patrick, here it is, the Palace of Pranks, the greatest novelty shop in Bikini Bottom. All the greatest pranksters shop here. This is where I got my gag... [the scene shows a close up of the can of Seanut Brittle.] seanut brittle can.
Patrick: Oh, boy, Seanut Brittle. Gimmie!
[Patrick tries to open the can.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, wait, it's a booby trap, remember?
Patrick: Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle! [opens the can and purple tubes pop out of the can] Where's the Seanut Brittle?
SpongeBob: [laughs] That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.
[SpongeBob walks off screen.]
Patrick: [starting to cry] Seanut Brittle?
[SpongeBob enters the Palace of Pranks and smells the air.]
SpongeBob: Ah! [Patrick enters the scene] Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items. [an aisle is shown] Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see! [walks down an aisle] Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?
Patrick: [in another aisle] Hey, Seanut Brittle! [purple tubes appear popping above the aisle that Patrick is in] Oh, darn it, not again!
[The scene only shows SpongeBob in his aisle. SpongeBob laughs. An old fish named Frank enters the scene.]
Frank: Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?
SpongeBob: Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.
Frank: [walks up to Patrick] Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick. [shakes Patrick's hand, but Frank has a joy buzzer, so it shocks Patrick. Patrick screams and sucks on his hand. Frank laughs.] That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.
Patrick: I don't get it.
Frank: You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.
SpongeBob: You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. [he and Patrick walk to the checkout counter and Frank is behind it.] Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.
Frank: Well, this came in just this morning. [shows a package of gum] Have some gum. [Patrick chews the gum but then he screams as his head explodes] Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.
Patrick: [His head is gone, leaving a neck bone in the shape of a femur and he talks muffled] I don't get it.
SpongeBob: [takes out a dollar.] What can we get for one dollar?
Yes, I just threw in a bunch of spongebob lines for testing. If u see this hi :)
